Problem Statement:
“ The Black Marketing of organs in India creates a barrier for individuals in need of life-saving transplants.”

Problem Description:
The illegal and unregulated trade of organs on the black market in India presents a major obstacle for those requiring life-saving transplants. This black market trade deteriorates the authenticity of the organ donation process and takes advantage of vulnerable individuals, leading to an ongoing shortage of available organs for transplantation. As a result, individuals in need of transplants face longer wait times and a reduced chance of success.

Project Description:
Our project aims to create a decentralized application for organ donation, specifically made for government. The data and information related to organ donations will be stored on an Ethereum-based smart contract, providing a secure and transparent platform for the process. The application leverages Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to prioritize patients based on their medical needs and predict the best match between organ donors and recipients. This will ensure that the most critical cases receive organs in a timely manner, based on factors such as blood type, medical history, and other relevant information. As a token of appreciation for their contribution, every successful donor will receive a unique, non-fungible token (NFT). This innovative solution combines the benefits of blockchain technology, ML, and NFTs to revolutionize the organ donation process and provide a secure, efficient, and fair platform for all involved.

Solution/Approach Details:
1. Machine Learning-based Recommendation System:  Using ML algorithm we will send recommendations to recipients about potential donors based on their health history, blood type, geographical location etc.

2. Data Management using Blockchain: Our platform have a secure database system since the data is stored in smart contract to store the health information and medical records of donors and recipients. This information will be accessible only by authorized personnel, and privacy maintained.

3. One-to-One Chat System: The website will also provide a secure one-to-one chat system for communication between donors and recipients. This chat system will allow for confidential and private communication, helping to establish trust and build a relationship between the two parties.

4. Rewarding with NFTs: Our platform recognizes and rewards successful organ donors with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a token of appreciation for their selfless act. These unique and collectible digital assets serve as a valuable and memorable reward for their generosity in saving lives.

By implementing this solution, we aim to provide a safe and trustworthy environment for the exchange of organs and to reduce the illegal trade of organs in India.
